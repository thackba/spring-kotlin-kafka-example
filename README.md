# Spring Kotlin Kafka Example

This is a small demo. It should show how two spring boot instances can communicate via Kafka.

If you want to try it you can use the Kafka Docker from Wurstmeister https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker

I used the SingleBroker Version with localhost as KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME.
